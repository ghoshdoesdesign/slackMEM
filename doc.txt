More questions the better! Likely other students have similar questions so keep asking :)
There are some general websites like ratemyprofessors.com and https://berkeleytime.com/grades which shows some past grade data.
My suggestion is to make a new post in students channel asking if anyone took a particular class you are interested in.
Then other MDes students could respond about their experience.
If anyone reading this does not have access to the students channel, please message me and I will add you.

On the approved electives list, a lot of the choices conflict with the times of our mandatory classes. Are we still able to consider those electives and if so, how would we manage our attendance for those classes?

Hello guys,
I am curious about how alumni and past mdes students manage their time during the first semester in the program. Did you do any extracurriculars in addition to your MDes classes? Do you recommend focusing on classes for the first semester only or can we do extra curricular activities, student orgs, and getting an on campus job even.

Amy Dinh  10:50 AM
Hi @Gia Kirk, if you plan to take this course to satisfy one of your MDes electives requirements, you should choose the Graded option, which means you get a letter grade for the course. The other option means you'd just get a Pass/Fail grade (for graduate students it's call Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory)

Marissa Maldonado  10:59 AM
When signing up for electives, if we have multiple added to our shopping cart to prepare for enrollment, should we enroll in all of them to ensure we get accepted or do one at a time? If we enroll in multiple and then get the one we want, would we just drop the other ones right after?
Hope that question makes sense, i just know that getting into electives can be a competitive process and we only get one elective for the semester. Thank you!

Yes, this is fine! Students often add multiple electives to their schedule if they're undecided or want to reserve a spot, and then drop the ones they don't want. That's part of what the adjustment period is meant for.

Amy Dinh  11:06 AM
The main things to be mindful about are any unit enrollment limits (you can't, for instance, enroll in 40 units ) and to drop any courses as soon as you know you don't want to take it--so that you don't get charged for it and so that the space is freed up for other students who are interested in that course.

Hello Christine. You don't have to enroll in your MDes rrequired course now. I will manually enroll all Mdes students from your cohort into the three required MDes courses for this Fall (DES INV 201, 202 & 210).
What are you referring to when you mentioned "I don’t see our MDes courses on the class schedule". Can you send me a link of what you are looking at?

Am I doing something wrong with CalCentral’s Classes Search? I find it bascially useless unless I already know the class code for a specific class. Here I am trying to find the class “Theory And Practice Of Tangible User Interfaces”. “User Interfaces” and “Interfaces” return no results, while “Tangible” for some reason works. Even when I copy the entire class name word for word, search gives no results. (edited)

Hi guys,
I'm choosing my elective...it's between ENGIN-283 Deplastify or Survey of Materials Science. And I wonder which class would compliment well with the MDes classes, I'll be taking in the fall.
I want to join ENGIN-283 this fall but I'm worried I might not have a lot of great ideas to contribute to the class. But if I take Survey of Materials Science, I can get a bit more knowledge on materials science such as plastic and join ENGIN-283 Deplastify.
But Deplastify just sounds so fun. Although the other thing I'm worried about is not being to use a lot of what I learn from Survey of Materials Science in my other MDes classes.
I have read about some of the MDes students experience in the Deplastify class above. Would be great to hear if anyone has taken Survey of Materials Science and would recommend it or not.

Hi everyone,
I am an incoming student of MDes, and I have a question regarding the recommended number of units for the first semester, excluding being any roles as a GSI or similar responsibilities.
I am currently thinking whether I should enroll in an additional elective (will be 2 electives; 17 units in total). If anyone would kindly share their experiences, I would greatly appreciate it.
Also, the course I'm considering is DESINV 190 1 Special Topics in Design Innovation: Human-Centered Design Methods. If anyone has taken this course, I would like to know more about the comments or workload about it.
Thanks!

Yes. There's a Final Term Reduced Course Load for this scenario:
Final Term RCL
Degree-seeking students who are completing their degree requirements in a specified semester can enroll for as many or as few units as needed to graduate. Access the Final Term Reduced Course Load online request form(link is external)
Eligibility for Final Term RCL
(collapse)
To be eligible for Final Term RCL, students must meet the following criteria:
The student must be on the degree list for the specified semester
The student must graduate at the end of the semester
The enrollment cannot be in 100% online coursework and must include in-person classes or units.
An academic advisor (college or major advisor) or Graduate Student Affairs Officer must recommend the reduced enrollment and approve the online Final Term RCL form.
Options for after the term ends
(collapse)
F-1 students will have a 60-day grace period for a one-time departure from the U.S. or transfer to another school, advancement to a higher degree level, change of nonimmigrant status, or application for Optional Practical Training.
J-1 students will have a 30-day grace period for a one-time departure from the US. To be eligible for Academic Training, J-1 students must submit an application to BIO at least 3 business days prior to the last day of their academic program.

The following is written with AI authorship : We write to express concerns about grading inconsistencies in our courses. Initially, a relaxed grading approach was verbally promised. However, as the term progressed, this shifted to unexpected strictness, creating confusion and distress among students. Such a change not only questions the reliability of initial assurances but also significantly impacts our academic and professional futures. Grades are pivotal in shaping opportunities.

OpenSayAPP  5:10 PM

Continuing, the inconsistency in evaluation methods – what is discussed, written, and implemented – creates an environment of uncertainty. Students prepare based on initial guidelines, and abrupt changes lead to a sense of injustice. Additionally, there's a notable discrepancy in deadline enforcement between students and faculty. Students face severe penalties for lateness, while faculty deviations often go unaddressed. This double standard erodes principles of fairness and mutual respect, essential in academia. Also, responses to students' extenuating circumstances vary, indicating a lack of uniform policy application and potential bias.

Given these concerns, a thorough reassessment of grading policies and their implementation is imperative. Aligning verbal assurances, written guidelines, and actual grading practices is crucial for fairness and transparency. These posts seek to initiate internal dialogue for change. Upholding academic integrity and fairness is vital for the program's reputation. We urge the faculty and administration to address these issues seriously, aiming for an academic environment that not only challenges intellectually but also adheres to the highest standards of fairness and integrity.

"These posts seek to initiate internal dialogue for … fairness and transparency". 
We, the faculty, would love to hear more, and it sounds like your cohort and your peers across cohorts would as well.  I know that many of us, students, staff, faculty, and leadership, are on a break and are not as tuned in and responsive to this communication channel as we would be during the academic sessions.  Your feedback means a lot to the faculty and leadership, and we want you to succeed.  The discussion you seek may need to wait until January for the faculty and leadership to have adequate representation to respond as a group.  Reaching out to specific faculty may yield more immediate results.  Have a great break!

MDes community,
I'm writing to let you know that I have removed the OpenSay app from the MDes Slack workspace, which was a mechanism that allowed anonymous posts. Here's why I've done so:
The MDes program is deeply committed to the empowerment and participation of the whole community, and strives to ensure that all viewpoints are heard and valued. Co-creation, however, requires open and transparent communication, especially on matters as important as those raised in threads above. To this end, we have established a number of pathways for students to offer feedback and express their concerns (in the interest of concision, I'll enumerate these in a separate thread). Some of these are anonymous and private (such as the end-of-semester course evaluations). Some of these include ways for students to air their concerns privately with their peers, to find common purpose, and to speak to the wider community with a common voice. The value in such pathways lies not in the anonymity of an individual student, but rather in the collectivity of a common voice. While there are naturally some situations that require the protection of a student's identity, these are quite rare (I've only encountered a handful in my ~20 years as an educator), and have less to do with community-building and more to do with resolving a serious but local grievance.
With these principles in mind, while I take the issues raised to be quite serious and worthy of attention and discussion, I found the anonymous posts sent yesterday to be an ineffective approach to addressing them, as well as an inappropriate use of this forum.
In contrast to the other pathways mentioned above, these posts are anonymous and public. This is an unhelpful combination. While the public-ness of the posts is a clear call to action, the anonymity at work here makes meaningful action impossible, as we have no context for the claims presented (e.g. as Director, I don't know which assignments, courses, cohort, or instructors to follow up with here). The anonymity also ensures that we have no way of knowing how many students share the experiences and concerns expressed therein, which makes the urgency of action unclear. Are these the experiences of small number of individuals which might be better addressed in conversation with their instructors, or are they shared widely across a cohort? I find the result to be in direct opposition to the authors stated aim of "initiating internal dialog for change", since the terms, stakes, and stakeholders of this change have been intentionally obscured. Even the voice of the author is obscured here, as they've chosen to screen themselves behind the veil of AI-generated text.
In a separate post, I'll share some thoughts about appropriate pathways for students to meaningfully participate in shaping the culture and governance of our program. I'll also share some campus resources for students facing more acute situations that require the resolution of academic grievance. Finally, since this appears to be a situation in which students may feel more free to speak among their peers, I'll be asking the newly-elected MDSA officers to help the administration better understand the specific issues that have been raised, and what possible next steps might be appropriate.
On a personal note, I'd like to express how committed I am to ensuring that everyone in our community feels valued, heard, and feels comfortable speaking their mind. If you have something important to say, I hope you are willing to use your own voice and stand behind your words. If doing so makes you feel at risk or uneasy, I think you'll find someone in this wonderful community that is willing to stand beside you.
In community,
Kyle

Hello Jade. The first payment due date for Spring 2024 is 1/12. However, there are no punitive measures associated with not paying your bill on this date. You will not be dropped from classes, charged late fees or have your campus resource access restricted.
This date (1/12) is just the first of 5 monthly billing cycles during the Spring semester.
If you pay your bill at this time and make adjustments to your course schedule (add or drop units) after payment, you'll have to either pay for any additional units added or you'll receive a refund from the university in the case of dropping courses.

Hello MDes2024. Today is the last day to drop classes without a fee in CalCentral. If you drop a class after the end of today, you'll be charged a $10 fee.
To avoid the $10 fee, please DM me in slack if you want to drop from a course after today. I can drop you from the course and waive the drop fee, however, I cannot waive the fee if you perform the drop function in CalCentral after today.
Just to clarify, you can still add courses without a fee until the end of next Friday (February 2nd; $5 fee to add a course after this date) and you can perform enrollment functions (add, drops, swaps) as a graduate student until Friday, February 16th, end of day,
To be safe, send me your enrollment request to avoid any fees between now and Friday, February 16th.
